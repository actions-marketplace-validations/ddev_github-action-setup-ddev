name: 'Setup DDEV in Github Workflows'
description: |
  This action installs **DDEV** in your Github Workflow.
  It's main use case is to run your Continuous Integration
  tests against your already configured development environment. 
  That'll facilitate developing your tests â€“ if they run locally, 
  they'll run in github actions, too.
